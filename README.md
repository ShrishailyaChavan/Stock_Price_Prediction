# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Model In Python

# About 

Used : Python, Plotly

Implementation and Visualization

Developed a stock cost prediction model using LSTM and an interactive dashboard to visualize stock analysis

• Imported stock price dataset of Tata Global Beverages Limited to make stock price predictions using the LSTM model.

• To develop the dashboard for stock analysis, used another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook.

• Created a dashboard to visualize the predicted stock costs with actual stock costs.(Plotly)
